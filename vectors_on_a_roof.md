An air-conditioning unit is fastened to a roof that slopes at an angle of $35\degree$ above the horizontal (__Fig. 1.34__) Its weight is a force $\vec{F}$ on the air conditioner that is directed vertically downward. In order that the unit not crush the roof tiles, the componenet of the unit's weight perpendicular to the roof cannot exceed 425 N. (1N == .2248 lb.)

(a) What is the maximum allowed weight of the unit?

(b) If the fasteners fail, the unit slides 1.50 m along the roof before it comes to a halt against a ledge. How much work does the weight force do on the unit during its slide if the unit has the weight calculated in part (a)? 
The work done by a force $\vec{F}$ on an object that undergoes a displacement $\vec{s}$ is W = $\vec{F}\cdot \vec{s}$
