1.1 - A theory isn't established based off of a number of experiements and it isn't disproven in that regard either. I theory is proven or disproven by established evidence in experiments

1.2 - It isn't possible compute the tangent of 5.00 meters because distance is one dimensional, there are situations where taking the tangent of 5.00 meters may represent a distance of something two dimensional. For instance, $$\tan{\frac{5.00}{1.00}} is completely valid.

1.3 - What is my height in centimeters?
    (6) * (12) * (2.54) 

1.4 - NIST maintains several accurate copies of the international standard kilogram. Even after careful cleaning, these national standard kilograms are gaining mass at an average rate of about 1 $\mu$g/f (y = year)when compared every 10 years or so to the standard international kilogram. Does this apparent increas have any importance? Explain. 

Yes the specification of what a kilogram is and how accurate that is depending on what application has implications for all measurements. Furthermore, the larger the disparity between the standards of kilograms, the more conflicting the information it.

1.5 - cosmic cycles are a good representation of time

1.6 - taking a number of sheets and stacking them up the to point of an inch, centimeter or milimeter then dividing that by the number of sheets

1.7 - what are dimensionless quantities other than that of $\pi$?
    degrees and radians are dimensionless as are common proportions/percentages

1.8 - The units of volume are measured in distance or fluids cubed.
        The volume of a cylinder is given by the area of a circle multiplied by the height of the cylinder or $\pi r^2 h$. It is partially possible to have a cubed result from an integral, but that would require that the original constant contain $\frac{1}{3}$ to bring the constant of the resulting equation to unity, and this equation is presented in a form that would indicate that it is a formula still yet needing to have the dimensions of the applied cylinder inputted into it.
    
1.9 - precision vs. accuracy
        being precise has to do with the grouping of the arrows
        being accurate has to do with the proximity to your target that you are
    
1.10 - Both are unit vectors
