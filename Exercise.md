    According to the label on a bottle of salad dressing, the volume of the conents is .473 liter (L). Using only the conversions 1 L  = $1000 cm^3$ and 1 in. = 2.54 cm, express trhis colume in cubic inches.

.473 L = $(.473 * 1000)cm^3 = (.473 * 1000)/2.54 in.^3 = (18.622 x 10in^3)$

    How many nanoseconds does it take light to tracel 1.00 ft in vacuum? (This result is a useful quantity to remember).

1.5 How many years older will you be 1.00 gigaseconds from now

1.6 The following conversions occur frequently in physics and are very useful.
    (a) Use 1 mi = 5280 ft and 1 h = 3600 s to convert 60 mph to units of ft/s.
    (b) The acceleration of a freely falling object is 32 ft/s^2.
        Use 1 ft. = 30.48 cm to express this acceleration in units of m/s^2
    (c) The density of water is 1.0g/cm^3. Convert this density to units of kg/m^3.
